However, previous results often rely on the\ncontinuous-time dynamics, assuming that species have overlapping generations.\nIn contrast, numerous real-world communities consist of species with\nnon-overlapping generations, whose quantitative behavior can only be precisely\nrepresented by discrete-time dynamics rather than continuous ones. Here, we\ndevelop a theoretical framework and propose a metric to quantify the stability\nof complex communities characterized by non-overlapping generations and diverse\ninteraction types. In stark contrast to existing results for overlapping\ngenerations, we find that increasing self-regulation strength first stabilizes\nand then destabilizes complex communities. This pattern is further confirmed in\nboth exploitative (E. aerogenes, P. aurantiaca, P. chlororaphis, P.\ncitronellolis) and competitive (P. putida, P. veroni, S. marcescens) soil\nmicrobial communities. Moreover, we show that communities with diverse\ninteraction types become the most stable, which is corroborated by empirical\nmouse microbial networks. Furthermore, we reveal that the prevalence of weak\ninteractions can stabilize communities, which is consistent with findings from\nexisting microbial experiments.

To resolve\nthese issues, in this paper, we develop noise calibration, data synthesis, and\nenhancement methods for STEM images.

The parameters\nof background noise, scan noise, and pointwise noise are obtained by\nstatistical analysis and fitting of real STEM images containing atoms.

To address this gap, we\nintroduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed\nviSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal,\nCausal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for\neach category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction\nReasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human\njudges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while\nGPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary\nmodels, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning\ntasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort,\nRISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual\nediting and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we\nare committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support\nmore comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation\nmultimodal systems.

We seek to quantify the spatial scale of star formation in\nthe spiral arms, using Cas OB5 as a pilot target before extending our study to\nmore distant and extinguished regions of the Galaxy. We selected 129,695\ncandidate OBA stars in a 6x8 deg$^2$ region around Cas OB5. We applied a\nspectral energy distribution (SED) fitting process to this sample to derive the\nphysical parameters. Through this process, we found 56 379 OBA stars, which we\nthen clustered using HDBSCAN. We identified 17 open clusters inside this area,\nfour of which appear to form a coherent structure that we identify as Cas OB5.\nNevertheless, our findings suggest that these clusters belong to two different\nage groups despite sharing a similar position and kinematics. Spectroscopic\nobservations confirm the youth of NGC 7788 (10-15 Myr) compared to NGC 7790\n($110\\pm15\\:$Myr). We have determined a spatial scale for star formation of a\nfew tens of pc to a few hundreds of pc, comparing the clustered to the diffuse\npopulation of Cas~OB5 across this part of the Perseus arm. A spectroscopic\nanalysis was required to complement the clustering algorithm, so that we could\nseparate younger OCs (tracers of the spiral arm) from older ones.

Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions\ncan trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the\nSMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it\n(momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from\nthe KRATOS suite (Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating\nbars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar\npattern speed: the program patternSpeed.py (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal\nfinite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results:\nIn the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like\ngalaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that\nsuffers a slowdown from $\\Omega_p \\sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\\Omega_p \\sim 0$\nkm/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr.

Recently, several MLIR compiler\nfuzzing techniques, such as MLIRSmith and MLIRod, have been proposed.

The difficulty in detecting silent bugs arises from two main aspects:\n(1) UB-Free Program Generation: Ensures the generated programs are free from\nundefined behaviors to suit the non-UB assumptions required by compiler\noptimizations.

Cloud-wide census of continuum sources showing low spectral indices", "abstract": "The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is measured to form stars 10\ntimes less efficiently than in the Galactic disk, based on emission from\nhigh-mass stars. However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which\naccounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate\n(SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and\nresolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds\n(DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm.

We find a cloud-wide deviation (>70%) from\ncommonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low\nspectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations\nfor the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower\nbrightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized)\ndust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore\nfrequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free\nemission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low\nspectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of\nmassive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal\nstellar initial mass function.
